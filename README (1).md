# Task-02: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to generate images from text prompts using a **pre-trained generative AI model** without training a model from scratch.

---

## 🧠 Description
In this task, a **pre-trained Stable Diffusion model** is used to convert text descriptions into images.  
The model has already been trained on a large dataset of images and text, so it can understand natural language prompts and generate corresponding images.

The program takes a text prompt as input and produces an AI-generated image as output.
